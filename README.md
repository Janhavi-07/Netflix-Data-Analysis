# 🎬 Netflix Movie Dashboard Project

This project is an end-to-end data analysis and visualization of Netflix movies. It combines Python for data cleaning and exploration with Power BI for interactive dashboard reporting.

---

## 📌 Project Highlights

- ✅ Cleaned and processed real-world Netflix data using Python
- ✅ Visualized key metrics using Matplotlib and Seaborn
- ✅ Built a professional Power BI dashboard with slicers, KPIs, maps, and trend analysis

---

## 🧹 Jupyter Notebook: Data Cleaning & Exploration

The dataset was preprocessed using Python in Jupyter Notebook:
- Removed null and blank values
- Dropped duplicate records
- Corrected and optimized data types
- Performed initial visualizations using:
  - `Matplotlib`
  - `Seaborn`

✅ The cleaned dataset was then exported for use in Power BI.

## 📊 Power BI Dashboard

The Power BI dashboard includes the following insights and interactive elements:

### 🎯 KPIs
- ⭐ Most popular movie (highest popularity score)
- ❗ Least popular movie (lowest popularity score)
- 🎥 Total movies released
- 📅 Year with the most movie releases

### 🎛️ Slicers
- Filter by:
  - Original Language
  - Genre
  - Release Year
